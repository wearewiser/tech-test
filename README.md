# Wiser Technical Test (PHP)

Bullhorn (http://bullhornstaffing.com) is a CRM for recruitment agencies. It allows Wiser's recruitment consultants to track new job applications and manage candidates through the recruitment process - from application, to interviews and finally when they're placed in a role.

# Your Test

Create a Laravel application that allows you to submit a new candidate remotely to Bullhorn, through an HTML form, using the Bullhorn API.

# Specifications

1. Laravel 5
2. The application requires a username and password login to access
3. The form must submit data using AJAX
4. The application must create a new Candidate entity on Bullhorn, then parse their CV which is uploaded through a file input.
5. Once the candidate is created and the CV is parsed, the application must display a success then get that new candidate record from Bullhorn and display it in a table - again, all through AJAX.
